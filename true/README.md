# Generated Swift SDK

- `Models/`: generated Swift models (Input/Output and shared models)
- `Apis/`: generated API wrappers grouped by feature
 
Usecase-specific `Input` and `Output` models are declared at the top of each API file.

Function names are usecase names, and model names match backend model/usecase type names.
